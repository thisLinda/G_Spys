## A Note About This Project
This is my final project for Stanford's innovative Code in Place program which brought online learning to a global 
cohort of 10,000 students during Covid lockdown. This is my first Python project and utilizes Tkinter, Python's 
"de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package" as introduced in the course. 

## I Spy
During quarantine sanity walks I took pictures of things I found interesting and would normally point out to others.
Turning the images into an I Spy "book" seemed a fun way to share and engage, remain involved, teach vocabulary, 
and a perfect project idea!
